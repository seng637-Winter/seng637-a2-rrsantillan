# 1 Introduction

In this group assignment, we conducted black-box testing using the JUnit framework. The System Under Test was a modified version of JFreeChart as provided in "jfreechart-1.0.19.zip". Specifically, various methods within the Range and DataUtilities classes were tested.

This document will outline how we developed our test plan and will summarize our results for each of our tests. Additionally, we will be discussing how we collaborated and divided the work amongst ourselves, and any challenges we encountered along the way.

## Setup

Note, to run all the tests, run the `TestRunner.java` file (found in `JFreeChart\src\org\jfree\data\TestRunner.java`) as a JUnit test. This should run all 10 tests at the same time.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

The test cases for `Range` and `DataUtilities` were developed using a mixture of Equivalent Class Testing, Boundary Value Testing, and educated error guessing. This included a pre-defined set of values, including nominal values, max and min, and `null` values.

## `Range` Testing

For our `Range` methods we tested, we came up with a set of pre-defined values in Boundary Value Notation, shown below.

| Abbreviation | Value                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| AUB          | 10.1                                      |
| UB           | 10                                        |
| BUB          | 9.9                                       |
| NOM          | A Double value in between our LB and UB (i.e. in between -10 & 10) |
| ALB          | -9.9                                      |
| LB           | -10                                       |
| BLB          | -10.1                                     |

## `DataUtilities` Testing

The values we used for our `DataUtilities` methods were slightly different compared to our `Range` values. Each method showcased different functionalities. As such, we used values that made sense given these differences. Additionally, we used `jMock` to mock values for `Values2D` and `KeyedValues` to aid in our testing.

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

### Setup and Configuration: 
There were difficulties in setting up the java project to run properly, especially with importing the external jars and setting up the project configurations. There was an outdated JUnit library that was causing issues which was resolved by downloading a more recent jar file of the library. Going through the error logs produced by the console helped us diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Testing Scope:
During the project, defining the testing scope posed a significant challenge. We used equivalence and boundary value testing to define our input parameters which helped us cover a wide range of testing cases without creating too many tests. To define the input ranges for the test cases, we sat down and discussed the various options as a team and selected concrete value ranges and inputs for our tests.

### Merge Conflicts:
Since each person worked on separate methods for testing, combining everything together for the final submission was a challenge. This required coordinating the changes for consistency. We discussed different options to fix merge issues and ultimately decided on separate files for each test which could be run through the `TestRunner.java` file to run all of our test files.

### Tests Causing Errors:
Identifying and troubleshooting errors caused by the testing process itself presented an unexpected obstacle. In some instances, automated tests inadvertently triggered errors within the system, leading to misleading results. Investigating these errors required careful examination of the tests to help identify the root cause and reduce the frequency of these errors.

To expand on this, since this is the first time any of us have used a testing framework like JUnit along with jMock, we were unsure of the difference between an Error and a Failure. The confusion was mostly due to the fact that, after running our test cases, Errors were donoted by a red X while Failures by a blue X. Before we realized the difference between the two, our initial test results came back with all red X's, which we thought meant that the methods failed the assertions. It was only until we saw blue X in these initial test results that we realized the difference. Afterwards, we were able to adjust our code to effectively test the correct way.

### Lessons Learned:
In this lab, we learned the benefit of planning test values on paper before coding any test cases. This method can minimize the corrections to our code as we move on to writing the test cases. Thinking about how to test a portion of a particular application beforehand allows the test writer to focus on simply writing the test cases more. Of course, tweaks were made where needed but the idea is to lessen this to make the testing process more efficient.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab provided valuable practice opportunities for JUnit, JMock, and the construction of Unit Test code, which we anticipate will greatly benefit our professional development. We are grateful for this learning experience.

The lab assignment markdown file was comprehensive, but its length and tone sometimes made it confusing to read through. Certain information, such as that in section 2.2.4.3 ("If you have divided the tests and completed them individually, then upon completion of the tests, review each otherâ€™s tests, looking for any inconsistencies or defects in the tests themselves."), feels like it clutters more important information and could be placed in a separate additional information section at the end.
